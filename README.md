  ## 📌 Introduction
  
  A sequential machine learning model to solve 5 character captchas with remarkable efficiency. The model was trained on around 1070 images which were initially pre-processed using openCV to remove the line that usually cuts the captcha image. The model finally predicted the image label with the accuracy of **89.32**.
